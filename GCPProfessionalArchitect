Projects
networks
sub-networks


Projects:
----------
- associates objects & services with billing.
- default of 15 networks in each of the project that can be shared/peered. additional quota can be added.
- there is no specific IP range for these networks. i.e. each resource is assigned a specific IP & togther it construct all of IP addresses.
- there are 3 types of Networks	
	> Default
	> Auto
	> custom
	
		Default Networks:
		--------------------
		 - every project is provisioned with default VPC network with preset subnets and firewall rules.
		 - Each subnet is allocated for each region with non-overlapping CIDR blocks (unique blocks for IP address range) & firewall rules that allows
		 Ingress traffic for ICMP, RDP, SSH traffic from anywhere.
		 
		 Auto-Mode Network:
		 ----------------------
		 - one subnet will be created in each region.
		 - IP addresses have a range with /20 mask that can be expanded to /16
		 
		 
		 custom Mode
		 ----------
		 - No deafult subnets created
		 - IP ranges expandable upto user specified.
		 - conversion of Auto-mode to custom mode is possible, but other way around is not possible.
		 
 
 Routes & firewall rules
 ---------------------------
- by default, every instances in a network will have routes that can send traffic to each other & also to subnets.
- by default, every network will have a default route that directs packets to destination that are outside the network.
- for packets to reach destination, firewall must configured accordingly.
- default networks have pre-defined firewall rules that allow all instances to talk to each other. for manually created networks, we need to define firewalls.
- A Route will be created when
	> new network is created
	> new subnet is created.

Pricing
----------
per-second billing, with minimum of 1 minute
	- vCPU, GPU, GB of memory
	
Resource-based pricing
	- Each vCPU and GB of memory is billed seperately.
	
Disks
---------
Persistent Disks: 
this disk will be attached to VM via network interface.
- disk not directly attached to VM, so it can survive the VM termination.
- Bootable: can attach to VM & boot frm there.
- Dynalically resize while its running.
- this same disk can be attached to many VM as Read-only.
- offers replication across zone, regions which can be good option of high-performance foro high availability.

- when performing Zonal or Regional replication, user can select one of the disk types
	> Std Persistent disks (pd-standard)    : these are backed by std hard disks that are suitable for large data processing workloads that primarily use sequential I/O's.
	> SSD Persistent disks (pd-ssd)         : these are backed by solid-state drives that are suitable for Enterprise apps that needs low latency and use more IOPS than std Persistent disks.
	> Balanced Persistent disk (pd-Balanced): are also backed by solid-state drives, these are alternative to (pd-ssd) balances performance and cost.
	uses maximum IOPS similar to pd-ssd and use lower IOPS / GB. these kind of disk offer better performance & value for money for general-purpose apps.
	> Extreme Persistent disk (pd-extreme): are Zonal only. are backed by solid-state drives. meant of high-end database workloads. 
	here, user can have desired IOPS. 
	


Local SSD:
- physically connected to virtual machine, provide high IOPS.
- data will be saved for reset, but not on VM Terminate.
- cannot attach to other VM.


RAM disk:
- use tmpfs to store data in memory.
- suitable for fast performance on small set of data.
- 

Elastic Google Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation
************************************************************
	Interconnecting Networks:
	---------------------------
	Cloud VPN -
	there are 2 types of cloud VPN
	1) HA VPN
	2) Classic VPN : connects on-premises network to Google cloud VPN via IPsec VPN tunnel.

	HA VPN:
----------
- is a High-availability VPN solution.
- connects On-Premises network to Google cloud via IPSec tunnel.
- when user creates a HA VPN, google cloud automatically chooses 2 external IP for 2 of its fixed interfaces.
- each HA VPN gateway supports multiple tunnels.
- user can create multiple HA VPN gateways.
- VPN tunnels using HA VPN must use dynamic Routing (BGP)
- user can create Active/Active or Active/Passive depending on the Route priorities.
- HA VPN supports Site-to-site VPN in one of the below scenarios.
	> an HA VPN Gateway to Peer VPN devices.
	> an HA VPN gatewyas to AWS private Gateway.
	> 2 HA VPN Gateways connected to each other.
	
- there are 3 peer gateway configuration for HA VPN
	> an HA VPN Gateway for 2 seperate peer VPN Devices, with ach having its own IP address.
	> an HA VPN gateway for 1 peer VPN Device that uses 2 IP addresses.
	> an HA VPN gateway for 1 peer VPN Device that uses 1 IP addresses.
	
	
Classic VPN : 
----------
- connects on-premises network to Google cloud VPN via IPsec VPN tunnel.
- traffic between these 2 networks are encrypted by VPN Gateway.
- does not support "dial in " to VPN using client VPN software.
- supports:
	> STATIC Route
	> DYNAMIC Route
	> site-to-siteVPN
	> IKEv1 & IKEv2 ciphers.
	
Note: for On-premises, the max transfer unit (MTU) cannot be greater than 1460 bytes.

Cloud interconnect & peering
******************************
- way to connect user's infrastructure to google Network.
- these services can be split into 
	> Dedicated connections
	> shared connections
	> Layer 2 connections
	> layer 3 connections


	* Direct Peering
	* Career Peering
	* dedictaed Interconnect
	* Partner Interconnect
	
	> Dedicated connections:
	-----------------------------
	- provide direct connection to google networks.

	> shared connections
	--------------------------
	- provides a connection to google network through a partner.
	- 

	> Layer 2 connections
	-----------------------
	- uses a VLAN that pipes directly into GCP Environment. 

	> Layer 2 connections
	-----------------------
	- provides access to google workspace service like Youtube & google cloud API's using public IP addresses. 



2.2 Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services

04 Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services
********************************************************
- Identity & access Management (IAM)
- Storage & database services 
- Resource Management
- Resource Monitoring


	- Identity & access Management (IAM)
	-----------------------------------------
		- Organization
		- Roles
		- Members
		- Service Accounts
		- Organization restrictions


		Google cloud resources are organized in heirarchy as shown below.
		1. Organization
		2. Folders
		3. Projects
		4. Resources
		
	
		- Each resource has exactly one parent.
		- The organization resource represents your company.
		- roles granted by each level are inherited by other components below the heirarchy.
		- folder resource could represent your department.
		
					Organization Node:
					- is a root node for cloud resources.
					- roles: 
						> Organization admin : control over all the cloud resources.
						> Project creator 	 : can create projects.
						> G suite or Identity access admin can assign organization admin role to users.
					
				
					Folders:
					- roles:
						> Admin   : full control over resources in that folder.
						> Creator : Browse Hierarchy & create folders.
						> Viewer  : view folders, projects below the resources.
						
					Projects:
					- roles:
						> creator : create new projects (automatic owner) & migrate new projects into organization.
						> Deleter : Delete projects.
				
				
			
			Roles
			----------
				There are three types of roles in Cloud IAM, 
				> Basic roles
				> Predefined roles
				> Custom roles.
				
				Basic role types:
					> Owner					: full administrative access. This includes the ability to add and remove members and delete projects.
					> Editor 				:  modify and delete access. This allows the developer to deploy applications and modify or configure its resources.
					> Viewer				: read only access.
					> billing administrator : manage billing and add or remove administrators without the right to change the resources in the project.
				
			
			Predefined roles:
				> provides members with granular access to specific GCP resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources.
				> Compute engine has predefined rules.
					~ Compute Admin: Full control on compute resources.
					~ network Admin: Full control on Network resources except firewall & SSL Certificates.
									 In other words, the network admin role allows read only access to firewall rules SSL certificates, and instances to view their ephemeral IP addresses.
					~ storage Admin: Permissions to create, modify, delete images & snapshots.
					
					
				
			
		
			Members: WHO on google cloud..
			-----------------
			Any email address that is associated with a Google account can be an identity, including gmail.com or other domains.
			
			There are five different types of members: 
			- Google Accounts, 
			- Service Accounts, 
			- Google Groups, 
			- Google Workspace domains, and 
			- Cloud Identity domains.
			
					
		service accounts:
		---------------------
		There are three types of service accounts: 
		- user-created or custom accounts
		- built-in accounts
		- Google APIs service accounts
		- This account is identifiable by the email project-number-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
		
		

Storage and Database Services
----------------------------------
In this module, we will cover 
- Cloud Storage
- Filestore
- Cloud SQL 
- Cloud Spanner 
- AlloyDB
- Firestore
- Cloud Bigtable 
- Memorystore

		when to use which database services
		-------------------------------------
		1) if your data is STRUCTURED?
			if NO, then ask if you need file sharing system.
				if YES, select Filestore,
				   if No, select Cloud storage.
				   
		
		
		
		Cloud storage:
		------------------
		- it's an object storage service.
		- used for
			> website content
			> data archival
			> Disaster Recovery or Distributing large object data to users via Direct download.
		- features
			> scalable to exabytes of data.
			> time to first byte in milliseconds.
			> highly scalable across all storage classes.
			> single API across all storage classes.
			
		- it is NOT like a files in filesystem.
		- it is a collection of buckets that you place bucket into.
		- you have specific URL to access Objects.
		- Cloud storage has 4 types of storage classes.
			> standard
			> Nearline
			> coldline
			> Archive
			
			Standard: 
			-----------
			- suitable for frequently accessing data.
			- Hot 
			- stored for brief period (very less days)
			- most expensive.
		
		cloud storage is broken down into different items
			- Buckets
			- Objects
			- Access
			
			
		
	Filestore:
	------------
		- Fully managed NAS(network access storage) for COMPUTE ENGINE & GKE instances.
